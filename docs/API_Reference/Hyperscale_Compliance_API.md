# Hyperscale Compliance API

The Hyperscale Compliance API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

**REST**

Hyperscale Compliance API is a RESTful API. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. A REST API will allow you to access and manipulate a textual representation of objects and resources using a predefined set of operations to accomplish various tasks.

**JSON**

Hyperscale Compliance API uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to ingest and return representations of the various objects used throughout various operations. JSON is a standard format and, as such, has many tools available to help with creating and parsing the request and response payloads, respectively.
Here are some UNIX tools that can be used to parse JSON - [Parsing JSON with Unix Tools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1955505/parsing-json-with-unix-tools). That being said, this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to JSON parsing and the reader is encouraged to use their method of choice.

**API Client**

The various operations and objects used to interact with APIs are defined in a specification document. This allows us to utilize various tooling to ingest that specification to generate documentation and an API Client, which can be used to generate cURL commands for all operations.
